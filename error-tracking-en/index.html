      <p>There are no programs without errors. Their number can be reduced with the great help of a type system, linters, tests, or even a whole department of testers, but it’s impossible to remove them completely. This is the reality we must face and the best thing we can do is to learn how to track these errors and fix them as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-shouldnt-work-with-errors">How you shouldn’t work with errors</h2>

<p>It’s quite common in development: programmers wrote some code, released a new version of a website or application and moved on. In the meantime, some users start experiencing problems: something freezes, crashes, issues with sending forms out, data could be displayed incorrectly, and so on. This may last long enough till someone would lose patience and finally decide to complain to the support service. Then, along the chain, it makes it to the programmers, and they try to find the root cause behind the error, when and who caused the bug or error to happen. The clarification of all the details begins, and most likely with the possible user’s participation, who is willing to help. With this approach, a huge number of errors remain unnoticed for a really long time, and the worst part is that users leave. Can we avoid the whole thing? Clearly, we can.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-work-with-errors">How to work with errors</h2>

<p>There are plenty of services called Error Trackers. They collect information about occurring errors in real time and notify the development team about them. These services integrate with multitude of platforms available around, from televisions to mobile applications and websites (both frontend and backend).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/error-tracking/rollbar-dashboard.jpg" alt="Rollbar Dashboard" /></p>

<p>Above is a screenshot of a dashboard service <a href="https://rollbar.io/">rollbar.io</a> which we use for all our Hexlet projects. You can track the frequency of critical errors in the last 24 hours for each project. This graph with performance metrics helps you diagnose issues immediately. And below is the output of errors of a specific project. According by the icons, most of the errors are caused by JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/error-tracking/rollbar-project.jpg" alt="Rollbar Project" /></p>

<p>Every such service provides libraries for different languages and platforms, they are usually added to the code and called in case of errors. These libraries send not just the error but also additional information about environment that can help. Such information may include data about users, their browsers, application settings, and more.</p>

<p>Ideally, that kind of library is already <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/rails">integrated</a> into some framework, for example, Rails. Then you don’t have to configure barely anything, it will be enough to connect the library as a plugin to the framework and then it will start detecting errors by itself, without extra interaction. If there is no such integration, well.. then you will have to write some code to link your application to the library. More information on how to do this you can find in the service documentation. <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/react">Here</a> is an example of Rollbar integration into React. Once the connection is successfully established, the detected error will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/error-tracking/rollbar-error.jpg" alt="Rollbar Error" /></p>

<p>If we take a closer look at the top menu, we can see that tabs provide pretty useful information about errors.</p>

<p>But detecting an error is only half of it. Then you need to notify the team somehow without flooding everyone with spam. The thing is that errors usually don’t occur only once. If it’s a common error and the number of users is high, then you can easily catch one error thousands of times per minute. And if there is a notification for each occurrence (by email or in Slack), then such a service wouldn’t work long.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/error-tracking/rollbar-notifications.jpg" alt="Rollbar Error" /></p>

<p>That’s why such trackers work more cleverly. When the error occurs for the first time, the service notifies the development team with real-time alerts so that they can quickly address it. If it happens once again, then no more alerts. At least not every time. For example, alerts can be sent at the first, tenth, hundredth, thousandth and so on occurrence. This is the first part. Further, after updating the application version, trackers label errors as “corrected”. This makes it much easier to track errors that developers either forgot to fix or fixed improperly. Most often, alerts start pouring in after the deployment. In order to prevent future issues, you need to notify the tracker service about deploys. You can read more about this in the <a href="https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/deploy-tracking">documentation</a> of the relevant tracker.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Error tracker is a very impactful tool, and it’s hard to imagine any production without using it. At that one of many services or specialized software can act as an error  tracker (for example, <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a>), a service installed on servers in case of high security requirements.</p>
